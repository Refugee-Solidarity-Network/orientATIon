We therefore strongly advise you to not believe persons who promise resettlement in return for money or any other financial benefits. These practices are clearly fraudulent.</p>\n<p>Another possibility for going to a third country is through family reunification. Applications for family reunification should be directly made to consular representatives of these countries in Turkey. Procedures of family reunification differ for each country. Many countries require that the family member in the third country initiate the process, and most of them only accept nuclear family members (meaning your spouse and children below the age of eighteen).</p>\n<p>Finally, if you have a valid travel document and a valid visa, you may also travel to a third country.

        "answer": "\n<p>In Turkey, a marriage ceremony can be performed between a freely and fully consenting man and woman. Persons wishing to marry must be bachelor at the time they apply for the marriage. In Turkey, the legal age for marriage is 18. Persons who have turned 17 can marry when there is parental consent or an approval of their legal guardians; under exceptional circumstances, persons who turned 16 may be granted a permission to marry by the court.</p>\n<p>In addition, persons wishing to marry must have “legal capacity.” Under Turkish Civil Code, persons lack “legal capacity” if they have not attained the age of majority or lack the ability to discern (i.e. the ability to act rationally and to distinguish right from wrong) as a result of a mental illness, weakness of mind, intoxication or of other similar reasons. In this connection, it is important to emphasize that a mental illness does not necessarily constitute a barrier to the marriage in and of itself. In other words, for a mental illness to prevent marriage, it must significantly affect the ability to discern. Thus, persons struggling with a mental illness are also entitled to the right to marry by obtaining an official health report which shows that it is not a medical impediment. </p>\n<p>Under Turkish law, close kinship is another barrier to marriage. A marriage between immediate family members, between some close relatives (aunts and uncles cannot marry their nieces or nephews, or ex-spouses cannot marry each other’s parents or children), and between an adoptee and an adopted person (and each other’s’ ex-spouses or children) are all prohibited.</p>\n",

        "answer": "\n<p>You have the right to benefit from basic procedural safeguards, no matter what reason you are placed under administrative detention. The first of these is to know why you are under administrative detention and to appeal this decision.</p>\n<p>Competent authorities have to inform you in a language that you can understand, on what grounds you have been placed under administrative detention. This information should include what kind of consequences the administrative detention decision will have, how you can appeal this decision and how long the administrative detention can last. If you have a lawyer or legal representative, they are also notified.</p>\n<p>There will be regular monthly assessments about the necessity to continue the administrative detention. If necessary, this evaluation can be made earlier, without waiting for the one-month period to expire. As a result of this evaluation, the duration of the administrative detention may be extended, terminated or other measures called “alternatives to administrative detention” be applied. The decision, whichever may be, must be communicated to you in a language you can understand. You can find more detailed information on the duration of administrative detention in the following sections.</p>\n<p>You also have the right to appeal against the administrative detention decision using judicial mechanisms. You can find further details about appeal procedures below.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, you also have rights guaranteed by law while held in the removal center in a detention facility. Over the course of your detention at a removal center, you have the right to food, emergency, psychological and primary health care services, including access to a hospital when necessary, age- and gender-appropriate accommodation, access to the telephone, and a safe storage for your valuables. In addition, you have the right to have your embassy or consulate notified of your detention and to enjoy access to consular assistance.</p>\n",

According to the current regulations, the authority responsible for evaluating the appeals against the administrative detention decision is the Criminal Judgeship for Peace. It is essential that the Criminal Judgeship for Peace evaluates this application within five days and concludes it.

You cannot appeal to a higher court against this negative decision. However, if you think that the administrative detention conditions are no longer applicable or there has been a change in your situation, you can appeal again.</p>\n<p>Persons under administrative detention are not allowed to leave their location and go to the courthouse in order to file a lawsuit.

Deportation decision is taken for the following persons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those who violate or attempt to violate the provisions of legal entry into or exit from Turkey;</li>\n<li>Those who use false information or fabricated documents in transactions for entry, visa and residence permits to Turkey;</li>\n<li>Those who are found to be working without a work permit;</li>\n<li>Those who are found to be making a living from illegitimate means during their stay in Turkey;</li>\n<li>Those who exceed the visa or visa exemption period for more than ten days or whose visa has been canceled;</li>\n<li>Those whose residence permit has been canceled;</li>\n<li>Those who violate the residence permit period for more than ten days without an acceptable justification;</li>\n<li>Those who are considered to pose a threat to public order, public security or public health;</li>\n<li>Those who are leaders, members, supporters of a terrorist organization or leaders, members or supporters of a criminal organization for profit;</li>\n<li>Those whose application for international protection is rejected, who are excluded from international protection, whose application is considered inadmissible, is withdrawn, or is considered withdrawn, whose international protection status has expired, terminated, or canceled, and who do not have the right to stay in Turkey after a final decision.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You or your legal representative or lawyer will be notified in writing about the deportation decision.

If necessary, you can benefit from interpretation support during this notification.</p>\n<p>If a deportation decision is issued, you can apply to the competent administrative court within seven days to appeal this decision. If you appeal this decision in due time, your deportation process will not be carried out until the court examines your appeal and makes a decision. In other words, an appeal to the court against the deportation decision suspends the deportation process and you can continue to stay in Turkey until a final decision is made.</p>\n<p>Appealing the deportation decision and appealing the administrative detention decision are two separate legal proceedings.

        "answer": "\n<p>If you do not fear a risk of persecution upon being returned to your home country or to your former habitual residence or you left your country for work opportunities or education, you may not benefit from international protection. Similarly, leaving your home country or your former habitual residence to escape a criminal prosecution for serious and non-political crimes will not make you eligible for an international protection status. However, even if your personal situation falls into one of the above-mentioned categories, yet you fear a risk of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, or punishment upon being returned, Turkish authorities are under the obligation not to send you back to your home country or your former habitual residence. This obligation also applies to persons who are at risk of being subjected to the death penalty. You may therefore be granted “subsidiary protection” which is also a form of international protection in Turkey.</p>\n<p>In addition, under international law, several groups of persons are excluded from the scope of international protection. Persons who have committed crimes against humanity or peace as well as persons who have committed war crimes will be outside of the scope of international protection.</p>\n<p>For further information about international protection eligibility criteria you can contact the Refugee Support Line of Refugee Rights Turkey, at <a href=\"tel:+902122924830\">+90 212 292 48 30.</a></p>\n",

For example, unaccompanied minors are not taken into administrative detention as per current legislation. For other people with special needs, an evaluation can be made by considering the individual situation. Considering your special condition, whether administrative detention is necessary or whether the conditions of the place where you are held are suitable for your special needs will be evaluated For this reason, it is very important that you convey your private and sensitive situation to the authorities.</p>\n<p>In addition, if you have been subjected to torture, sexual assault or other serious psychological, physical or sexual violence in any way, we recommend that you inform the authorities without delay. It is understandable that you are hesitant to share the violence you have suffered.

        "question": "I am under 18 years old and alone in Turkey. What are my rights as a foreign child in Turkey?",
        "answer": "\n<p>Everyone under 18 years of age is considered to be a child in Turkey. This means that everyone under 18 years old can enjoy the rights and services granted to “children” in relevant Turkish laws. Where you see the word “child” or “minor” in this information, this refers to everyone under the age of 18.</p>\n<p>If a child has arrived in Turkey without their mother, father, or other adult caregiver or relative; or lost contact with them after coming to Turkey, they are referred to as an “unaccompanied child” or “unaccompanied minor”. All children, regardless of their nationality, religion, gender, or any other characteristic, can benefit from the rights and services offered to children in Turkey.</p>\n<p>The Ministry of Family and Social Services (in Turkish: <em>A</em><em>ile ve Sosyal Politikalar Bakanlığı</em>) is the official body responsible for the protection of children in Turkey. When children are identified to be unaccompanied, they are accommodated at facilities suitable for their age and gender which are operated by the Ministry of Family and Social Services. They can stay at these shelters until they turn 18. Children living in shelters have their basic needs such as food, health, education, and clothing, provided for free at these facilities. These facilities are officially referred to as Child Support Centers (in Turkish: <em>Çocuk Destek Merkezleri</em>), but are also frequently referred to as “facilities”, “centers” and “dormitories”.</p>\n",

Police officers undertake the identification of your age based on a review of your documents, such as your passport, identity document(s), and your birth certificate. To understand if you are considered accompanied or unaccompanied, police officers will ask you several questions regarding your family’s whereabouts, how and when you became separated from them, and the police officers record this information. If there is no doubt about whether or not you are in fact under 18 years old and are unaccompanied, then police officers will accompany you through several medical tests, including a test to assess whether you have any contagious diseases. At the end of these procedures, you will be taken to a facility suitable for your age and gender.</p>\n<p>An age assessment may be considered necessary by the police if you do not have any documents to prove your age or if authorities believe you look older than 18 or if, for some reason, you had been previously registered by Turkish authorities as being older than 18.</p>\n<p>These police officers trained in working with children will then accompany you to a public hospital for the age assessment. All aspects of these identification procedures are free-of-charge: you do not have to pay for anything.</p>\n",

This assessment is made by a doctor or a board of doctors working at a hospital.</p>\n<p>The human body, especially your bone and tooth development and the changes that occur during puberty, help doctors to identify your biological age. The most common method by which age assessment are carried out for minors in Turkey relies on the assessment of bone development looking at an x-ray of your wrist bone. Both the physical examination and the tests, including taking x-rays, are carried out gently and in a way that will not be physically or psychologically painful or harmful to you. The doctor examining you and assessing your age should inform you about the purpose of the age assessment and the methods being applied.</p>\n<p>A police officer trained in working with children and, if needed, an interpreter, will accompany you throughout the age assessment procedure.

        "answer": "\n<p>It can be difficult to properly identify a person’s age through the age assessment process, and for this reason, the results you receive may sometimes be mistaken. The human body’s development can take place at a different pace in different countries based on climate, the available foods, and genetic factors. Age assessments should take all of these factors into consideration, but there is still a need for greater research on their impacts. In addition, sometimes the age assessment only estimates the age range of a minor such as “between 15 and 17 years old”, rather than 16 years old and 5 months. In this case, your age may be registered differently, depending on the final assessment of the doctor.</p>\n<p>It is possible to raise an objection to the results of an age assessment. In this case, you may approach the hospital where the initial age assessment was completed, or you may have an alternative test completed at the forensic department of another medical facility specialized in age assessments. In forensic medical departments, an age assessment is made based not only on bone development but also based on the assessment of the body as a whole. When challenging the results of an initial age assessment, it is helpful to obtain a test based on this kind of more comprehensive assessment. You should then present the results of these alternative tests to the Provincial Directorate of Migration Management, or to a court. It is important to consult with and be assisted by a lawyer in this type of case. Refugee Rights Turkey can give you advice about these procedures and help you with the appeal process.</p>\n",

If you are between 8- and 17-years old, you will stay at designated facilities according to your age and gender. 8-to-12-year-old boys and girls stay at a certain facility, whereas boys ages 13 to 17 and girls ages 13 to 17 stay at separate facilities.</p>\n<p>In provinces such as Istanbul, where a high number of unaccompanied minors are identified on a regular basis, you may first be asked to stay at a temporary facility for a few weeks, before being transferred to the facility where you will stay until you turn 18. Usually, you will stay at designated facilities with along with other minors from different nationalities. It is also possible to be placed at mixed facilities along with Turkish minors under institutional care, often because of some special conditions or issues regarding facility capacity.</p>\n<p>Each facility has a certain capacity, for instance, on average 20 to 40 minors can stay at a single facility. However, the capacity and physical conditions of facilities can vary.</p>\n<p>Each minor staying at a facility has a “counsellor” who is responsible for them. Your counsellor is an official who works at the facility as a psychologist or teacher. It is expected that you primarily share your needs, any challenges faced at the facility or other types of concerns with your counsellor. You will be informed of who your assigned counsellor is when you are placed at a facility, and usually this counsellor will also inform you about the facility’s rules and other important information. Apart from your counsellor, you can also consult with other adults working at the facility including teachers, officials, nurses, cleaning and kitchen attendants, and the facility’s administrators.</p>\n<p>The facilities where you and other unaccompanied minors stay at are places which are suitable for your age and gender, and where your basic needs are provided for.

Accordingly, if this is your case then you will be taken under the state’s care at a state facility, as explained above.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you may stay with a family member or relative, if you have any in Turkey, or with a foster family. In all these scenarios (staying at a facility, with a relative, or with a foster family), the authorities will need to make an assessment in consideration of your best interest as a child. If you request to live with a relative or family member in Turkey, the Ministry of Family and Social Services makes an assessment regarding your request, and examines the living conditions of your relative in order to understand whether this family member/relative can take care of you. You can stay with your family member or relative only after the Ministry has approved your request. It is not possible for an unaccompanied minor to live alone; you will either be taken under the care of a facility, placed with a foster family, or where applicable, with your own family member.</p>\n",

        "answer": "\n<p>As an unaccompanied minor, you can stay at Ministry of Family and Social Services facilities until you turn 18. You are expected to leave the facility following your 18<sup>th</sup> birthday. In Turkey, individuals 18 and older are considered to be adults and, as per current practices, adult asylum seekers are expected to take care of their own accommodation. In other words, adult asylum seekers rent a house or apartment for themselves, and they provide for their own living and needs.</p>\n<p>In some exceptional circumstances it may be possible to continue staying at the facilities for a short term, or for a longer period, after turning 18 if you need to do so in order to continue your education or for any other special circumstances. Here, special circumstances refer to circumstances like turning 18 before you are going to leave Turkey, (for example, for family reunification) in a few weeks, and therefore you cannot settle somewhere on your own before leaving Turkey, or if for example you are about to recover from a serious health issue and have been permitted to stay for slightly longer before moving out of the facility. Even in such exceptional situations, the capacity of the facility and in some cases a decision from the court on the extension of the protection measure are important in determining whether or not an extension of your stay at the facility is granted.  </p>\n<p>The majority of unaccompanied minors staying at facilities feel anxious about their lives after turning 18, especially about where they will live, how they will sustain their living and the procedures they will need to undergo. It is normal to have these anxieties about the future. If you have any similar concerns, you can talk to your counsellor or with other facility staff.

        "question": "Am I allowed to work while staying at the facility?",
        "answer": "\n<p>Unaccompanied minors’ employment is subject to certain rules regarding both the employment of foreigners and the employment of children in Turkey.</p>\n<p>First, with very few exceptions, it is prohibited for minors under the age of 15 to work as per relevant Turkish laws. Also, all foreigners are expected to acquire a work permit in order to be able to work legally in Turkey. It is very risky to work without a work permit in Turkey because if you face any problems or abuses while working without a permit, you may have difficulties in applying and receiving support and protection from the police or other government agencies. In addition, if you work without a work permit you may face various sanctions, including having to pay a fine.</p>\n<p>Under current Turkish law, it is the employer who submits an application for a foreign employee’s work permit. A work permit is then granted or denied by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security after assessment of the information and documents provided by the employer. If you would like to work you should first discuss this with your counsellor at the facility, because your potential employer can only submit a work permit application for you if they are permitted by the administration of the facility where you are staying. Please see <a href=\"https://multecihaklari.info/services/labor-market/\">additional content on Access to the Labor Market</a> on our Information Portal for Refugees for further information on employment in Turkey.</p>\n<p>It is not very common for unaccompanied minors under institutional care to obtain a work permit and work somewhere. Difficulties in acquiring a work permit aside, unaccompanied minors are primarily encouraged to continue their education and to access the labor market only after completing their vocational or academic education. If you have questions about accessing your right to education in Turkey, you may consult the other questions on education here, or visit the <a href=\"https://multecihaklari.info/services/education-for-syrian-refugees/\">Education section</a> of our Information Portal for Refugees in Turkey.</p>\n<p>If you are enrolled at a vocational high school and a mandatory internship is part of your school curriculum, it is possible to complete your internship with coordination between your school and your shelter facility’s administration.</p>\n",

        "question": "I was staying at a facility but I left without permission. Is it possible for me to return?",
        "answer": "\n<p>It is possible to return to the facilities where you were previously staying at and which you left without permission. You should go to the nearest child police station or directly to the facility you used to stay at in order to be reregistered at the facility. If your status of the unaccompanied minor has not changed, meaning if you are still under 18 years old and unaccompanied, it is possible to once again be taken under institutional care after relevant medical tests have been carried out.</p>\n<p>It is risky to leave the facility you are living at without permission. You may encounter ill-intentioned people or may be forced to live in harsh conditions. Similarly, it is not possible after leaving a facility without permission, it is not possible to continue benefitting from your rights such as education, access to healthcare, access to accommodation, food, pocket money etc. Leaving a facility without permission is therefore both dangerous and difficult.

        "question": "I want to submit a family reunification application to be reunited with my family members living elsewhere. What do I need to do?",
        "answer": "\n<p>Family reunification is the process of coming back together with your family members who have ended up living in different countries to live together in the same place. For family reunification to happen, the authorities of the country where your family members want to live together must give their permission and issue travel visas for those family members who are currently living outside of this country. The conditions under which family members are allowed to reunite and what documents are needed to apply for family reunification vary from country to country.</p>\n<p>Usually, countries only allow spouses (husbands and wives) to reunite with one another, and for unaccompanied minors to reunite with their parent or parents. In some countries, it may be possible for unaccompanied minors to be reunited with their unaccompanied siblings or adult siblings, or first-degree relatives (uncles, aunts, grandmothers and grandfathers). In addition to the degree of relationship, the income and legal status of your family member or members in the destination country are also taken into consideration.</p>\n<p>Information on family reunification can be obtained from the consulates of the destination countries, or from NGOs or lawyers informed about these procedures.

        "question": "Can I continue my education while staying at a facility?",
        "answer": "\n<p>Education is a fundamental right in Turkey, and anyone who wishes to continue their education may do so at any age. As an unaccompanied minor staying at a shelter facility, you can also continue your education. If you would like to continue your education, you should share this desire with your counsellor at the facility.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to access education in Turkey: the first way is called “formal learning” and refers to joining courses in a classroom at a school with other students; and the second one is called “distance learning”, where you follow the courses yourself via an online platform and take relevant exams afterwards.</p>\n<p>If you are ages 6-14, you should complete your elementary and secondary school education at school. If you are 15 and older, you can complete your elementary and secondary school education only via the distance education model. If you are a teenager and have completed elementary school and secondary school and are between the ages of 14-18, you can complete your high school education either formally or via the distance learning model.</p>\n<p>The first step to continue your schooling in Turkey is to determine what grade you are in. It is helpful to provide documents that demonstrate any education that you have previously completed, especially any school records from the grade you most recently completed, to the officers working at the facility you’re staying at. The Ministry of Education also carries out an examination to determine your grade level in case you cannot document your previously completed education.</p>\n<p>In Turkey, the language of education is Turkish. If you are not yet proficient in Turkish you may be referred to special classes called “harmonization classes”, where you will first focus on learning the Turkish language, and can then continue to the appropriate grade after one or two semesters of Turkish language orientation.</p>\n",

        "question": "I fear going back to my country of origin. Is it possible for me to seek asylum in Turkey?",
        "answer": "\n<p>If you cannot go back to your country of origin due to war or for fear of persecution, you can share with Turkish authorities that you do not wish to go back home. This process is known as submitting an asylum application in Turkey. Asylum applications are submitted to the Provincial Directorate for Migration Management (in Turkish: <em>İlçe Göç İdaresi Müdürlüğü)</em>.</p>\n<p>The Turkish government grants “temporary protection” (in Turkish: <em>Geçici Koruma</em>) to Syrians arriving to Turkey due to the conflict that has been going on in Syria for the last decade. For this reason, Syrian nationals apply for temporary protection when applying for asylum in Turkey. If you are a Syrian unaccompanied minor, it is helpful to present your ID documents from Syria when applying for temporary protection.</p>\n<p>Asylum applications submitted by persons arriving in Turkey from countries other than Syria are called applications for “international protection” (in Turkish: <em>Uluslararas</em><em>ı Koruma</em>). While submitting an international protection application, you are expected to explain in detail the reasons why you cannot go back to your country of origin. If you have any, it will be helpful to share with the migration authorities any ID documents you brought with you, and to explain why you fear going back to your country of origin.</p>\n<p>If you would like to receive information about registration procedures for temporary protection or international protection; or about procedures following registration, please contact Refugee Rights Turkey at <a href=\"tel:+905495105206\">+90 549 510 52 06</a>.</p>\n",

        "question": "What rights do protection seekers have in Turkey?",
        "answer": "\n<p>Seeking asylum in Turkey, as explained above, means registering for temporary protection if you are a Syrian national, and registering for international protection if you are from a country other than Syria.</p>\n<p>After submitting an application for temporary protection or international protection in Turkey, you have the right to not be forcibly sent back to your country of origin (to not be deported) while your application is being reviewed and until it has been finally rejected. Therefore, it is very important if you fear going back home due to war or persecution to immediately begin asylum procedures in Turkey.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you register under temporary protection or international protection you have the right to stay in Turkey legally with either a temporary protection identification document or an international protection applicant document. While these documents are still valid, you can continue to stay in Turkey legally.</p>\n<p>In addition, temporary protection and international protection status provides you with access to various other rights:</p>\n<p>Syrians who have completed their temporary protection registration can benefit from basic rights, such as accessing education and healthcare, for free. They can also benefit from available social assistance opportunities, in accordance with existing the opportunities and priorities.</p>\n<p>International protection applicants and status holders can benefit from healthcare for free for a period of one year, starting from the date of their registration, if they don’t have the means to pay for their own healthcare. Individuals are expected to cover their own healthcare expenses after this one-year period has ended, with few exceptions. Similarly, individuals can benefit from free healthcare and from social assistance, in accordance with existing opportunities and priorities. Conditional refugee and subsidiary refugee status holders may also have access to additional rights and opportunities based on their status.</p>\n<p>The majority of these rights (in addition to some others) are given to unaccompanied minors due to their age, rather than any other legal status. For this reason, if you are an unaccompanied minor you can benefit from many rights and services whether listed or not listed here, even if you have not registered under a protection regime.</p>\n",

        "answer": "\n<p>It is possible to complete temporary protection or international protection registration procedures after you have left institutional care. In fact, in some situations, Provincial Directorates for Migration Management may request that your registration procedures and status determination interview be completed after you turn 18, considering that as a child, you may find it difficult to express your fear of return to your country of origin.</p>\n<p>If you are an ex-minor (if you recently turned 18) and cannot go back your country of origin due to fear of war and persecution and, as a result, would like to apply for temporary protection or international protection, it is very important that you do so as soon as possible. This is because the process of applying for protection in Turkey legalizes your stay in Turkey. In other words, any time spent in Turkey after leaving the facility and before completing your registration puts you at risk of being considered to be staying in Turkey irregularly.</p>\n<p>If you are an unaccompanied minor and are about to turn 18 and leave a facility, you should be informed about the procedures that you need to be aware of upon turning 18; specifically, regarding your life after leaving institutional care and the rights and obligations you have as an ex-minor.

        "question": "I am about to turn 18. What should I expect about post-18 life?",
        "answer": "\n<p>It is very critical to be informed about life after turning 18, especially in the lead up to your 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, at which time you will be expected to leave the facility. You can receive more information on this subject primarily by speaking with your counsellor at the facility where you are staying. You can also consult our hotline for unaccompanied minors, available at <a href=\"tel:+905495105206\">+90 549 510 52 06</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the most urgent and important issues concerning life after turning 18 is the question of your accommodation or housing. In Turkey, adult asylum seekers and migrants are expected to take care of their own accommodation needs. As an ex-minor leaving institutional care, you are expected to rent a house or apartment in the city where you are already registered or where you will be able to register for temporary protection or international protection. If you haven’t yet registered for temporary protection or international protection, you can receive information on where you can go to complete your registration from your counsellor at the facility where you are staying, and from the Provincial Directorate of Migration Management in your city. As mentioned above, completing temporary protection or international protection registration is a precondition for your legal stay and for access to your rights and services in Turkey.</p>\n<p>It is very costly to rent a house, buy furniture and cover various household expenses after leaving a facility. For this reason, ex-minors who will leave a facility around the same time often choose to rent a house together and share their expenses. There are some cash assistance opportunities for ex-minors leaving facilities, especially for those who are continuing their education in Turkey. Please contact Refugee Rights Turkey for more information on current opportunities.</p>\n<p>As an ex-minor, you will be expected to assume responsibility for all official procedures affecting you, as well as for your personal life after leaving the facility. Accordingly, you should follow up on all of your administrative obligations yourself, including completing your registration with the Provincial Directorate for Migration Management, living in your city of registration, and reporting regularly for signature duty if you are asked to. You should follow up on your access to education and healthcare. You can always contact Refugee Rights Turkey for information and advice on migration and asylum procedures, as well as access to other rights in Turkey.</p>\n",

        "answer": "\n<p>Your application for humanitarian residence may be rejected, for example, because the assessment is that you do not meet the conditions stipulated in the law. In this case, you are expected to leave Turkey within the deadline given to you by the immigration authorities.</p>\n<p>If you believe that you meet the conditions for humanitarian residence, you have the right to appeal the negative decision before the competent administrative court within 60 days of the notification of the decision. In this regard, it is extremely important that you seek the support of a lawyer as soon as possible after the notification of the negative decision, because if you do not leave Turkey within the time period that the authorities ask you to leave the country, you may be subject to deportation and administrative detention decisions. An appeal to the court against the rejection of your humanitarian residence request does not eliminate the risk of deportation.</p>\n",

        "answer": "\n<p>In Turkey, legal aid services are available for people who need legal assistance but cannot afford to pay the legal fees and costs of the proceedings without causing significant hardship to themselves and their families. In Turkey, legal aid is provided through bar associations. A bar association is a professional organization to which lawyers in a province or region belong. Within each bar association, there is a Legal Aid Office established to ensure that people who cannot afford to pay for legal fees and legal expenses can benefit from legal aid services. Asylum seekers in Turkey can also benefit from the services provided by Legal Aid Offices.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to afford legal aid, you can go to the bar association in your province and request legal support and counseling.</p>\n<p>In order to benefit from legal aid, you must not already be represented by a lawyer. If you are represented by a lawyer, you will not be able to benefit from legal aid.</p>\n<p>The bar association to which you apply for legal aid will first assess your financial situation. For this purpose, the bar association to which you are applying may request documents from various official offices to determine whether there is any property registered in your name, or other documents such as a poverty certificate issued by the mukhtar’s office. The staff at the bar association will also make an assessment of the merits of your request for legal aid. If both of these conditions are met, your request for legal aid may be accepted.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about legal aid, you can contact the legal aid office of the bar association in your province, our Refugee Rights Center or other civil society organizations for more information.</p>\n",

        "question": "What are my rights as a disabled refugee in Turkey?",
        "answer": "\n<p>Refugees in Turkey, i.e. persons under temporary protection or international protection, may benefit from some additional rights and services recognized for refugees with disabilities if they have a physical and/or mental disability. These rights and services aim to eliminate the disadvantages that persons with disabilities may face in asylum procedures due to their disability and ensure that they have access to the additional support they need.</p>\n<p>Refugees with disabilities are included under the category named “persons with special needs” under Turkish law. It is envisaged that registration and status determination procedures for refugees with special needs will be processed and completed faster and with priority. When refugees with disabilities apply for temporary protection or international protection to the Provincial Directorate of Migration Management (PDMM), they are directed by the migration authorities to the “protection desk” within PDMM, where an assessment of their basic needs, including health services, is made and referrals are made to relevant public institutions. International protection applicants and status holders remain covered by General Health Insurance for one year following their international protection registration, but persons with special needs, including refugees with disabilities, can continue to benefit from General Health Insurance with the approval of the migration authorities if they document their ongoing treatment needs.</p>\n<p>Refugees with disabilities are also prioritized for in-kind and cash support provided by district governorships or municipalities within their budgets, and for the cash support program known as “Social Cohesion Assistance” or <em>Kızılaykart</em>.</p>\n",

The status determination assessment related to your asylum (international protection) application to the migration authorities in Turkey is mainly aimed at assessing the risk of war and persecution you may face if you return to your country of origin.</p>\n<p>In some cases, disability may have been caused by past war or ill-treatment, or fear of return to the country of origin may be associated with disability.If you believe that you will be persecuted on return to your country of origin because of your disability, or that the authorities in your country of origin will not provide you with adequate protection against the risk of persecution in your country of origin because of your disability, you should make this clear to the authorities at your status determination interview.</p>\n",
