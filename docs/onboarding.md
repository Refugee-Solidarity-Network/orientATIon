# Guide for On-Boarding New Contributors

These instructions describe the project administrator's steps in bringing a new contributor on board to the orientATIon project.

## Step 1: Add Contributors to the Refugee Solidarity Network GitHub Organization

The first on-boarding step is to add members to the [RSN GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Refugee-Solidarity-Network), which will provide access to the [orientATIon](https://github.com/Refugee-Solidarity-Network/orientATIon) repository.

**Prerequisites**:

- Contributors must have a GitHub Account.

## Step 2: Add Contributors to the Refugee Solidarity Network AWS Organization

The second step to on-boarding is to add members to the RSN AWS Organization, which will allow users to use AWS' Single Sign-On (SSO) service to gain access to paid AWS services like Bedrock.

Users will need to be added to the `orientATIon-researchers` IAM Group in order to be provided the necessary permissions.

**Prerequisites**:

- Contributors must provide a valid email address in order to create a password and sign into their AWS sub-account.

Once contributors have been added to both the RSN GitHub and AWS Organizations, they will be able to access the shared Gitpod-based Workspace and authenticate their local session via AWS SSO.
