    "# Implementing Basic RAG QA with Langchain\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chain using our FAQ data. The overall approach is as follows:\n",
    "1. Load FAQ Data & Structure Metadata\n",
    "2. Create Embeddings for the FAQ Data using Amazon's Titan Embeddings model, and save these embeddings locally using Chroma.\n",
    "3. Create a Question Answering (QA) chain which retrieves context based on the embeddings saved in Chroma, serving these as context to the Amazon Titan Express LLM to answer the provided user prompt.\n",
    "4. Format the response so that source materials can be cited.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation mostly follows these Langchain tutorials:\n",
