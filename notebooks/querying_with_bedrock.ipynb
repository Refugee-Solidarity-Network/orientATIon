       "- Turkey is a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. This means Turkey has obligations under international law to provide protection to refugees.\n",

       "\n",
       "- There are two main types of protection for asylum seekers in Turkey: 1) Conditional refugee status for people fleeing events in Europe, and 2) Subsidiary protection for people not eligible for refugee status but still in need of international protection. \n",
       "\n",
       "- The Directorate General of Migration Management (DGMM) is the main government agency responsible for processing asylum applications and determining status. Applications are submitted in person at DGMM offices.\n",
       "\n",
       "- In recent years, the vast majority of asylum applicants have been from countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and Syria. The approval rate for refugee status has been low compared to subsidiary protection. \n",
       "\n",
       "- Turkey maintains a geographical limitation to the Refugee Convention, meaning only asylum seekers from Europe can be granted full refugee status. This has been controversial and criticized by refugee advocates.\n",
       "\n",
       "- There are some concerns about asylum procedures in Turkey not conforming fully to international standards in terms of fairness and efficiency. But reforms have been underway.\n",
