      "Question: What are the different ways to apply for the Feedback and Complaint mechanism?\n",

      "\n",
      "Pair 2:\n",
      "Question: Under what circumstances would I be eligible for free legal aid in Turkey?\n",
      "Answer: If a person cannot afford to pay for a lawyer and legal fees without causing considerable financial strain on themselves or their family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pair 3:\n",
      "Question: What am I entitled to before and after my 18th birthday?\n",
      "Answer: Minors have access to shelter, food, clothing, medical care, education, and pocket money. Upon turning 18, asylum seekers have access to less government-funded support, though accommodation, food, and medical care may be provided if the asylum seeker has special circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pair 4:\n",
      "Question: What issues should be contemplated before entering into a rental contract?\n",
      "Answer: It is important to make sure that you are negotiating and signing a contract with the rightful lessor or their authorized agent. The contact details of the landlord and the address of the rented property should also match the information on the title deed. Make sure that the terms of the contract have been thoroughly discussed and understood. This includes the rent cost, the method of payment, the date of payment, the terms of the security deposit, and the state of the property being rented. All of these considerations help avoid misunderstandings down the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pair 5:\n",
      "Question: What happens after my 18th birthday in regards to living arrangements?\n",
      "Answer: Upon turning 18, you are expected to find your own accommodations and provide for your own living expenses as an adult. This is due to Turkey's current practices of expecting adult asylum seekers to be independent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pair 6:\n",
      "Question: What are my options for seeking asylum in Turkey?\n",
      "Answer: As a refugee, you may seek asylum in Turkey by registering for either temporary protection or international protection. This protection status ensures that you will not be deported back to your country of origin while your application is reviewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pair 7:\n",
      "Question: What is important for beneficiaries to understand about the services provided by this organization?\n",
      "Answer: The organization provides legal assistance and they have explicitly stated that they provide clear and accurate information on the scope of their services. They also emphasize that their services are free, and they ask beneficiaries to disregard any claims to the contrary. They also stress that their staff does not accept any gifts or favors in order to avoid any perceptions of unfairness or bias.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pair 8:\n",
      "Question: What happens after my 18th birthday in terms of accommodation?\n",
      "Answer: Once an individual turns 18, they are considered an adult in the eyes of the law and are expected to find their own accommodation and provide for their own living expenses. However, there might be a possibility for a short-term extension of stay at the facility for a certain period after turning 18 if you can demonstrate the need for it, such as pursuing education or if exceptional circumstances apply (e.g. awaiting family reunification). The decision and duration of such extensions are made on a case-by-case basis and depend on facility capacity and judicial approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pair 9:\n",
      "Question: What should happen after I get released from the removal center?\n",
      "Answer: The authorities should inform you in writing about your release, status in Turkey, rights, entitlements, and any duties you might have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pair 10:\n",
      "Question: What is the purpose of registering with the Turkish authorities?\n",
      "Answer: Registration allows you to stay legally in Turkey and access public services under the temporary protection regime. It is also required if you want to travel outside of Turkey.\n",
